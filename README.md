# RIT-Gaze-Study
Work I completed for a high school research internship under Dr. Gabriel Diaz.
This repository consists of two projects:
- A project that parsed a set of data collected during a prior experiment and analyzed it to determine if a saccade occured.
- A project that parsed a set of data collected during a prior experiment and analyzed it to recreate what occured in a virtual reality simulation.

Saccade Analysis.py is a self contained script that handled the first project. 

ExperimentSimulation.py and DataExtraction.py work together with a missing file, LoadParameters.py to handle the second project.  This is run from ExperimentSimulation.py
